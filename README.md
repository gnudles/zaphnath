# zaphnath
Zaphnath is a symmetric key block cipher with a block size of 256 bit.
This package is still work in progress, and it should not be used for production purpose.
It's key feature is key-dependent bitwise rotations. It uses only shift-add-xor and thus it is resistant to side-channel attacks.
A work in progress is also being made on a new asymmetric encryption, currently only the key-sharing algorithm seem to be secure.
